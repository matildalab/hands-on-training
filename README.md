# Hands-on Training

Welcome to the hands-on training for the IPU and Poplar SDK.

# Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU)

The Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) is a highly parallel processor, specifically designed for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. An IPU-based system, such as an IPU-POD™ or a Bow™ Pod, connects to a host computer which can execute code on one or more IPUs. (To learn more about the IPU, see [IPU Hardware Overview](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/latest/about_ipu.html#ipu-hardware-overview).)

# Poplar SDK

The Poplar® SDK is the world’s first complete tool chain specifically designed for creating graph software for machine intelligence applications. Poplar seamlessly integrates with TensorFlow, PyTorch and Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) allowing developers to use their existing machine intelligence development tools and existing machine learning models.

Poplar enables you to exploit features of the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), such as parallel execution and efficient floating-point operations. Models written in industry-standard machine learning (ML) frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are compiled by Poplar to run in parallel on one or more IPUs. (To learn more about the Poplar SDK, see [Poplar SDK Overview](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/sdk-overview/en/latest/index.html).)
